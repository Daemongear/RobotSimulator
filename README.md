# RobotSimulator
Final year BEng Robotics project, this is the documentation.
This project covers 3 aims:

1) Making a physical robot's digital design and putting it in a simulator
2) creating a tutorial on setting up a WeBots simulation from a Fusin360 design
3) documentation for a TAROS paper submission on the topic of comparing CoppeliaSim with WeBots in terms of undergraduate use viability.


A workshop is planned for July 2021, further documentation will be uploaded then.
